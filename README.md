Tweak is a linux hex editor based on curses. I'm quite suprised by its highly scalable performance.
Original project homepage is at http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/tweak/ .
The original author also writes putty, one of the greatest tools I've ever used.

What I do here is to make tweak use vim like keys and commands.
I hope I can make it. :)
